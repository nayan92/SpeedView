# SpeedView

TODO
----
- Make the speedometer draggable
- Change border color to red if speeding and green if below speed limit
- Some way of notifying that camera is coming up
- Open camerAlert app by tapping on speedometer
- Fix rotation orientation
- Add an icon
- Clean up code

Notes
-----
The average speed view doesn't close immediately after exiting specs camera zone because of camera locations not set at motorway exits properly I think. Not sure this can be fixed easily. //TODO look into it.
